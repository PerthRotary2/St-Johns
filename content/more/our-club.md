We’re a club with a 40-year history of voluntary work, fellowship and fundraising.
Whether it’s supporting a local community project or responding to national or international disasters,
Rotary makes a big difference to our communities. With a global network of 1.2 million Rotarians around the world,
Rotary brings people together to exchange ideas, share perspectives and apply leadership to find solutions.

At Perth St Johns, we’re a vibrant and expanding Club, with a commitment to getting hands-on involved in what we do and making sure we enjoy ourselves along the way.

We welcome people of all ages (18+) and we have a great mix of people of both working age and retired.
With one of the largest proportions of female Rotarians in the district, members have occupations from across business, public and voluntary sector.</p>

From fundraising lunches to planting crocuses to installing a community defibrillator ... there's little we haven't tackled! But importantly, we’re also a network of friends.
Fellowship lies at the heart of Rotary and our weekly Club meetings give us the opportunity to develop those relationships.

The Club meets at the Salutation Hotel on most Wednesday lunchtimes. You can come to a meeting (or more!) to get a feel for the Club and meet everyone.
