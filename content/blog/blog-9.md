What does the word Rotary bring to your mind when you hear it :-

- A load of elderly gentlemen in dark suits?
- Does it mean that you have to attend every week?
- Does it show up as a most expensive lunch and much else to pay for?

Well, as far as The Rotary Club of Perth St Johns is concerned none of these assumptions are true. In fact the opposite is true :-

- We wear whatever we are wearing on a Wednesday lunchtime.
- We are made up of mainly women, who really give us a modern touch.
- We don’t quite adopt the attitude that all rules are made to be broken, but our attitude is not that far away.
- We know that you are bound to miss some Wednesdays and we allow for this.
- We have a basic lunch at a cost of just over £10.

We do raise quite a lot of cash and the vast majority of what we raise is given to Perth charities.

We really would welcome you in our club; long term and deep relationships exist in our club. 
Our attitude is about as far from formal as any might imagine. We greatly enjoy working together, and we enjoy the comradeship a lot.
So do come along and share a lunch or a Zoom meeting with us all to see what we are made of.
We are all of the opinion that with these hard days at work we need a short break to talk to friends and gain from their understanding and opinions.
