I’ve been a Rotarian, and a member of this club for over 40 years and Rotary has given me both friendship and fun.
My favourite project was, and still is, giving mock interviews to local 15 year olds.

My biggest benefit when not in Perth has been visiting other Rotary clubs, both in the UK and overseas; 100 in all;
friendly Rotarians in a strange place were both helpful and educational.
Admitting ladies, twenty years ago, was the best thing we ever did, and our club is now roughly 50/50.

Helping the community, which is what Rotary is all about, has a definite “feel good” factor; I can recommend it!
