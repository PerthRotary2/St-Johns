Fundraising is good, but our members enjoy a hands-on project even more.
We had a great time repainting the outside of the cafe at Perth's
[Walled Garden](https://www.visitscotland.com/info/food-drink/the-walled-garden-and-cafe-pkavs-mental-health-and-wellbeing-hub-p2548321).

The Walled Garden is part of PKAVS Mental Health and Wellbeing Hub, and has an excellent cafe and tranquil garden.
If you haven't been there, it's well worth a visit.
And in case you are wondering, yes, we can hold paintbrushes much better than we hold a camera!
