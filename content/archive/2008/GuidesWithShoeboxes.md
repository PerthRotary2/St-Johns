For some time the Luncarty Guides have supported the club with its commitment to the Rotary Shoebox Scheme. This year the guides broke all records by helping to meet the 200 box goal.

The Rotary Shoebox Scheme started in 1994 when boxes of gifts were sent at Christmas to children in the city of Lasi in Romania. Since then the scheme has grown throughout Britain and Ireland and many thousands of boxes have been sent to deserving children and families in countries across Eastern Europe. Now in its 14th year, the Shoeboxes have, over the years, reached far reaching destinations including Romania, Moldova, Belarus, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Albania, Kosovo and Croatia and each year the need seems to be ever greater. Although the boxes are particularly sought after at Christmas they are not solely for that time of year and whatever the time, they always go to deserving recipients. They are distributed either by other clubs or by known contacts and this ensures they do reach the intended recipient.

The guides have enjoyed their participation and their Leader “Mrs T” has been an enormous friend of the club with her drive and enthusiasm and has already ‘signed up’ for 2009. The girls are only too well aware of just how fortunate they are by comparison with the intended recipients and they are generous with their box fillers and their time.
