This fundraising event in Perth city centre was organised jointly by the three Perth Rotary clubs.

We were raising money for an SOS Children project to build a classroom and health centre for the fishing village of Kayankerni in Sri Lanka. 4000 people from the village are dead or missing. The 8000 survivors, half of them children, are now in emergency camps.
