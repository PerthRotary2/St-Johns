Vice-president Alexander presented a cheque for Â£358 to Perth Autism Support project co-ordinator Nicola Acford.

This was half of the proceeds of a concert organised with Perth and Kinross young musicians, held on June 7th at North Muirton Community Campus. The other half went to support the Perth and Kinross central music groups.
