At the Scottish Parliament with club member Alexander Stewart MSP.

We were delighted to host our old friends, and some new ones, on a weekend visit from Aschaffenburg. Activities included a tour of the Scottish Parliament, a trip to the V&amp;A Museum in Dundee, dinners hosted by our Rotarians, and an international Gavel competition.
