Teams from Oakbank and Viewlands Schools were joint winners of our annual Primary School Quiz.

For the first time ever, the top two teams couldn't be separated, even after a tie-reak round and six sudden-death questions. Both teams went forward to the Rotary zone round in April.

Once again, our thanks went to all the teams that took part, as well as their teachers and supporters.
