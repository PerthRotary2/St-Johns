Around 70 Senior Citizens had a most enjoyable evening at the Salutation Hotel, enjoying the superb music of the Dunkeld and District Strathspey and Reel Society. Rotary drivers provide transport to the event for those that need it, and for the first time we added a free raffle which proved a great success.
