We had two outstanding speakers - Tommy Docherty and Jim Leishman - at our Sportsmans Dinner this year. Both in their different ways are legends in the football sphere, and we had a great evening at the Lovat Hotel in Perth.

Thanks to our sponsors, generous gifts for the auction and our guests, we raised over Â£5000. The money raised at the dinner goes to our nominated charities, and also helps to fund our activites throughout the year.
