The Rotary Club of Perth St Johns is a vibrant and expanding Club, with a commitment to getting hands-on involved in what we do
and making sure we enjoy ourselves along the way. We represent a mix of age and occupations from across business, public and voluntary sector
and sport one of the largest proportions of female Rotarians in the district.

We are always looking for dynamic individuals from all backgrounds to join the Club.
Learn more about us and make contact via {{< extlink href="https://www.facebook.com/perthsjrotary/" label="Facebook" >}}.
Or why not come along to a meeting to get a feel for how we work?
